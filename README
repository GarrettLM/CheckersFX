DESCRIPTION:
	The CheckersFX is 2-player checkers game written in the Java language
	using the JavaFX platform.

	The source code is divided into two .java files:

		CheckersFX.java
		GameLogic.java

	CheckersFX.java contains the classes for the GUI of the checkers game
	as well as the main program itself. GameLogic.java implements the game
	rules as well as makes moves for the player.

	CheckersFX currently lacks an AI for the player to play against. It also
	doesn't keep track of the current turn.

REQUIREMENTS:
	CheckersFX requires either JDK 8 or OpenJDK 8 or later to compile and run.
	Additionally, it also requires the JavaFX or OpenJFX libraries. Depending on
	what version of the JDK or OpenJDK you have installed, these libraries may
	need to be installed seperately.

	(See the RESOURCES section for information on installing a version of the JDK
	or JavaFX libraries.)

COMPILING:
	To compile CheckersFX open the terminal and change the directory to one
	containing the CheckersFX.java and GameLogic.java source files. Use the
	following command to compile them:

		javac *.java

	If this fails you may need to use the following command instead:

		javac --module-path=</path/to/javafx/libraries/on/your/computer> --add-modules=javafx.base,javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics,javafx.media,javafx.swing,javafx.web CheckersFX.java

	If you are using a distribution of Linux and using the OpenJFX libraries
	then they path where they are installe may be:

		/usr/share/openjfx/lib

RUNNING:
	After you have compiled the source files, you can run the CheckersFX
	program using the following command from the directory with the compiled
	.class files:

		java CheckersFX

	If you had to specify a path to the JavaFX libraries when compiling you
	will need to use the following command instead:

		java --module-path=</path/to/javafx/libraries/on/your/computer> --add-modules=javafx.base,javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics,javafx.media,javafx.swing,javafx.web CheckersFX

ROADMAP:

	-CheckersFX currently lacks an AI for the player to play against.

	-A feature needs to be added to keep track of turns. Players also need
	to be prompted for what color they will play as.

	-Double jumps need to be added.

	-The ability to restart the game after it has ended needs to be implemented.

	-While units become kings when the reach the opposite side of the board,
	there is currently no change to their visual representation to indicate
	this.
